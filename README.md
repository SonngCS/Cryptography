# Cryptography

This repository contains pieces of code and algorithms related to cryptography and cybersecurity.

# DES #

This program is a reproduction of the "data encryption standard" algorithm in the C programming language and it was made when I was on my second semester at college.

# ransomware #

A basic ransomware iteration made in Python after following a couple of simple tutorials. This is an example made only for educational purposes, do not use it for other objectives, as it may result in legal issues. 

# GAR #

A basic program in C++ using Winsock2 to transfer files between two machines on the same network using TCP IP. This was made using CLION and the project folder was ported to Github. I am aware the code is not 100% clean, but since I am busy with another projects and work-related stuff, I will not be updating it any time soon, sadly... But I thought it would be better to post it in here anyway. The code was made using Microsoft's official documentations and tutorials at: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/getting-started-with-winsock
